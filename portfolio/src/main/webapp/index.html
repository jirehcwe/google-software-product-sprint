      <p>I'm creating this website as part of SPS, and this is my first time writing in HTML/CSS/Javascript.</p>

            This is one of the games I have created! It's titled "42 Ways to Improve Game Feel. 
            It's meant to be an interactive lecture to teach new game developers how to make any game feel good.
            Feel free to try it by clicking the picture!

            This is another game called "TEKITU", which stands for "The Edgiest Kid in the Universe".
            I made this game with 2 artists and another programmer in about 3 months! 
            This is one of the abilities of the main protagonist.

        This one is called Vector! I made this in 48 hours as part of a game jam (a hackathon for games.)
            I'm the guy on the left, and my friend/project partner on the right. Try it out by clicking the picture. 
            Be warned, it's a fast-paced game that combines fast reaction time with puzzle/problem solving!
